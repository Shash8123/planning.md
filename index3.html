            <span>1. 1991 Brazilian GP, Senna wins</span><br>
            With seven laps to go, and with his gearbox falling apart beneath him,<br>
            Senna had no option but to finish the race using only sixth gear,<br>
            in rapidly deteriorating weather conditions. He won just ahead of Riccardo Patrese and Gerhard Berger,<br>
            but had to be helped out of his car, and almost collapsed on the podium.<br>
            A win for Brazil, as much as for Senna, with more emotion than any man could bear. And perhaps a little bit of amateur dramatics.<br>

            Another occasion in which F1 transcended its remit and became bigger than motor racing,<br>
            thanks to the outrageous courage of one man: Niki Lauda. Six weeks after a priest read him the last rites,<br> 
            Lauda was back in his Ferrari, his face still raw from his injuries, his lungs ruined. He finished fourth that day in Monza. <br>

            <span>3. 2008 British GP, Lewis Hamilton wins</span><br>
            Although he'd almost won the title in his rookie season, it was this appearance in front of his home crowd that really gave notice that we had a once-in-a-generation talent on our hands.<br>
            Having qualifed fourth, Lewis had work to do, but he got a great start and quickly overhauled his team-mate, Heikki Kovalainen (remember him?) Mostly, though,<br>
            this was about watching Hamilton's sublime gifts shine through on a typically tricky, rain-lashed Silverstone day, when virtually every other driver struggled to keep their car on the island.<br> 
            "Racing here as a kid it was always wet," he later noted, "so it was a real good area for me to show my strengths. I loved that race, it was so much fun."<br>

            <span>4. Verstappen - Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in 2021</span><br>
            While the 2021 F1 season has sparked a heated debate about the finale feeling too much like a Hollywood script,<br> 
            the rivalry between 7-time world champion Lewis Hamilton and young up-and-comer Max Verstappen was action-packed until the very last lap.<br>
            When a late crash brought out the safety car, Hamilton kept his lead while Verstappen pitted, putting several lapped cars between them.<br>
            However, in a last-minute reversal, lapped cars were allowed past the safety car, bringing the leaders back to square one with one final green flag lap to race.<br>
            Verstappen passed Hamilton on newer tires, and while Hamilton fought until the very last corner, Verstappen would win his first championship title.<br>
